                  <h2>Digital Printing</h2>
                  <p>Digital printing refers to methods of printing from a digital based image directly to a variety of media. It usually refers to professional printing where small run jobs from desktop publishing and other digital sources are
                    printed
                    using large format and/or high volume laser or inkjet printers. Digital printing has a higher cost per page than more traditional offset printing methods but this price is usually offset by the cost saving in avoiding all the
                    technical
                    steps in between needed to make printing plates. Digital Printing also allows for on demand printing, short turn around, and even a modification of the image (variable data) with each impression.</p>
                  <p>We have integrated digital printing with quality and colour management software to generate the highest quality at reasonable prices. With our varied paper range and innovative product knowledge, we also offer to a niche market
                    segment who look forward for unique features in printing.</p>
